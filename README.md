**Implementation of the forked assessment.**

Intentionally excluded:
- No error handling for resource file parsing errors at runtime. The unit tests show that the resource files are parsed correctly, and the files represent a database in this assignment, so there is no use case for invalid files at runtime.
- No generated REST API documentation. Since the REST API contains only three methods, the code itself is the best possible documentation.

The task was fun, thanks a lot!
